  <h3>y first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I’m on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.”</h3><br>

  <h3>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: “Passing cars, When you can’t see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.” I definitely won’t be passing any cars. </h3> <br>
  <h2> August 20, 2012 </h2><br>
  <h3>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.</h3>
