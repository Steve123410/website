<h2>Q/A</h2>

<p>
Q)What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company? 
</p>
<p>
A) We have our Domain be our Github Repository (For me it is Steve123410) each subdomain is each folder we have ending with our html file
</p>
<p>
What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? 
</p>
<p>
An advantage is that using github is free, and safe. Some Negatives is we can not change our domain name, it has to be the name of your main repository unless you replace it with a specific domain name (Which you have to buy from a third party organization).
</p>
<p>
What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?
</p>
<p>
We could have bought a server like we used earlier in the year to set up domain names
</p>
<br>
<p>
What is the process to get a domain name involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?
</p>
<p>
You have to buy a domain name from a hosting company. You move your files over to the root folder by connecting to the hosting company using your username and password. You use the cd command to change to the directory where you wish to push your website( If you dont have the directory use the mkdir command to create the directory.) When you are in the correct directory using the put the command. Retrive files with the get command.
