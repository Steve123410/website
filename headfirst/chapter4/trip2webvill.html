<h1>Q/A Chapter 4</h1>

     <p> 
     Q)What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a hosting company? 
     </p>
     <p>
     A) We have our website name be our Github Repository (For me it is Steve123410) the absolute path to the html page is each folder the file is in ending with the HTML file.Something strange I noticed is that github websites do not have a protocol leading to the website name.
     </p>
     <p>
     What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? 
     </p>
     <p>
     An advantage is that using github is free, and safe. Some Negatives is we can not change our domain name, it has to be the name of your main repository unless you replace it with a specific domain name (Which you have to buy from a third party organization). Also we do not have a protocol leading to the site so it would not be shown as secure ie HTTPS://.
     </p>
     <p>
     What alternatives could we have used, and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?
     </p>
     <p>
     We could have bought a server from a hosting company like we used earlier in the year to hold our files. The hosting comany would also create the URL.
     </p>
     <p>
     What is the process to get a domain name involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?
     </p>
     <p>
     You have to buy a domain name from a hosting company. You move your files over to the root folder by connecting to the hosting company using your username and password. You use the cd command to change to the directory where you wish to push your website( If you dont have the directory use the mkdir command to create the directory.) When you are in the correct directory using the put the command. Retrive files with the get command.
